# Cifar10-GoogleNet-Pretrained

Part A:
1.Import the Cifar- 10 Dataset as required for this assignment. Further, for pretrained model we need the sequential model in place for measuring the accuracy of the model for the given dataset.
2.Set the batch size, epochs and the number of classes. Further, the iteration is set to 3 runs for this part of the assignment.
3.Add and define the module for the Googlenet network. The activation and the layers are defined as part of this step.
4.Further, we load the Cifar10 dataset using cifar10.load_data()
5.Loss, accuracy is defined
6.For 50000 samples, training is performed with epoch 30
7.Further, the model is evaluated based on the testing and training accuracy and losses.
